RUN NOTES:

--> We need to run Controller program twice, one for the Base Station
and one for the Buoy.

--> While running Controller, we need to pass command line arguments as follows:

args[0] = whether to run base station(-bs) or buoy(-bu)
args[1] = portToSendTo
args[2] = portToReceiveOn
args[3] {Optional} = IP address of the base station or buoy. If this is not provided, the program will take
the local host as the ip address. 


First we run the Controller with command line arguments indicating to run Basestation.
Before requesting anything from Basestation, we now run the Controller again with command line argument indicating to run Buoy.

Now in Basestation window, we can either request Image or sensor data or close the communication (By pressing respective choices).
Now in Buoy window, based on what is requested, we do the following.

If Image requested: Buoy will be prompted to give full file path including .jpg extension.
If Sensor data requested: Buoy will be prompted to give sensor data which is in Integer.  

The sensor data or Image is then transferred to the base station.
The base station can then press 3 to close the communication.

Run with the following commands :

1. java Controller -bs 63001 63000

2. java Controller -bu 63000 63001

NOTE: Note that the sending port of base station will be the receiving port of buoy and vice-versa.

Example of Image Transfer
-----------------------------------------------------
At Base Station: 
	Enter -> 1 (request image)
	
At Buoy:
	Enter -> *full file path including jpg extension*
		e.g. "C:\Users\anilp\OneDrive\Documents\minion.jpg"

At Base Station: 
		Image Received
		Enter -> 3
		Done Requesting

At Buoy:
		Done Serving Basestation.
		
Example of Sensor Data Transfer
-----------------------------------------------------
At Base Station: 
	Enter -> 2 (request Sensor data)
	
At Buoy:
	Enter -> 8 (or Any Integer)

At Base Station: 
		Received Sensor Data: 8
		Enter -> 3
		Done Requesting

At Buoy:
		Done Serving Basestation.
